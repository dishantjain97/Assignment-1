  <h1 >Thor Ragnarok : Movie Review</h1>
  <textarea rows="30" cols=100% readonly >
The hilariously self-absorbed God of Thunder returns for Thor: Ragnarok, a top tier addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to the smart and snappy voice of director Taika Waititi. Even though the film is comedy first and action second in its priorities, it is like getting stuck in the best game in the arcade for two hours.  

This time around, Thor faces the unshackling of his apocalypse-hungry sister Hela, played by a horned and horny Cate Blanchett. Hela aims to make good on her prophecy to destroy Asgard in retribution for her banishment, and presents Thor’s greatest physical threat to date. Once Thor is cast off himself to the technicolor planet Sakaar, he finds a cast of characters that might help him save his home, including lost Avenger Bruce Banner.
As ever with a Waititi film, Ragnarok is an ensemble effort. Hemsworth is especially attuned to the Waititi brand of goofball, while returning players Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston play mostly to their previous beats. Blanchett is perhaps given less to do than expected, but her Hela is equally intimidating and worthy of our diva worship. Her brightest contribution is the similarities she shares with her brother - she’s equally enamored by her own visage and physicality. Jeff Goldblum plays the Sakaarian Grandmaster with the kind of oddball attitude that only forwards his cult following. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie is intriguing and accessible, presenting someone truly compelling amongst the silliness. You’ll hardly care if you’re unfamiliar with the character - Thompson is a goddamn movie star.

Ragnarok and this year's Guardians of the Galaxy sequel suggest Marvel is moving in a more episodic direction, losing the sense of mounting cataclysm that has begun to weigh down the genre in recent years. This feels like a smart move - if we're going to be given an endless stream of these movies, it becomes a more rewarding experience if we’re not imprisoned to one connected sequential story. It primes the upcoming chapters, but think of Ragnarok like a delightful appendix.
